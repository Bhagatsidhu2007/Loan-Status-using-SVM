# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-SVM

This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict whether a person's loan will be approved or not based on their application data. It focuses on preprocessing raw features, training a robust classification model, and evaluating its performance to identify key factors influencing loan approval decisions. It includes:

* **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and converts all categorical features (like Gender, Education, Married status, Property Area) into numerical formats, making them suitable for machine learning.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes the relationship between key features (e.g., Education) and the loan approval status to gain initial insights.
* **Data Splitting**: Divides the processed data into training and testing sets, ensuring a stratified split for balanced class representation.
* **SVM Model Implementation**: Initializes and trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using a linear kernel to classify loan applications.
* **Model Evaluation**: Assesses the model's accuracy on both the training and unseen test datasets to determine its effectiveness.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of applying machine learning, specifically SVM, to solve a real-world binary classification problem in the financial sector.
